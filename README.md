This is a PyTorch Machine Learning Project where satellite images are analyzed to determine the presence of smoke and wildfires

when you have downloaded the repository I recommend:

    create a virtual environment
    run the virtual environment
    run the 'command pip install -r requirements.txt' to install dependencies

When that is all done, you can run the project with 'python ImageDetectionClassifier.py'
